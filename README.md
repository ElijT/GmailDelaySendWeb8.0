# Gmail Delay Send

The initial version of this GitHub project is **absolutely not mine** and is a copy of the v0.8 of Gmail Delay Send project hosted at https://code.google.com/archive/p/gmail-delay-send/ . This project really nice and I use it quite often, unfortunately the Google Code website is no longer open for modification, hence I transfer it here to make evolve and be updated!

# **Welcome to Gmail Delay Send**

> Gives gmail users the ability to schedule messages to be sent at a
> later time.

### Why was Gmail Delay Send created?

One of the top 10 requested features in Gmail is the ability to  schedule sending of messages, and with the release of the  [Google App Scripts](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/)  it was finally possible to implement.

### What does it do?

The project allows you to setup a system to create emails and schedule them to be sent at a certain time. You can compose them on any platform (eg. mobile/computer) and the only extra work is to apply a label and specify the time in which to send the mail.
